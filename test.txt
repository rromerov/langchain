The Eternal Voyage

Across the endless seas of time,
Where echoes fade, where stars align,
A vessel sails with silver light,
A phantom ship in endless flight.

The captain stands with eyes aglow,
A soul of fire, a heart of snow,
His compass spins, yet finds no ground,
Lost in whispers, lost in sound.

The ocean sings in endless tides,
Of kings once fallen, hopes that rise,
Of lovers lost in stormy waves,
And those who dream beyond their graves.

Through mist-clad isles of memory,
Where silent ghosts drift ceaselessly,
He charts a course through fate unknown,
A mariner by stars alone.

The Isles of Lost Tomorrows

The wind it calls in spectral tones,
To lands where golden ages shone,
Where empires rose, then turned to dust,
Bound to time’s unyielding thrust.

Upon the shores of shattered fate,
The footprints fade, the echoes wait,
For those who walk with fearless stride,
To learn what lingers, what has died.

Through ruins draped in ivy's clutch,
Where time and nature’s fingers touch,
The ship drifts on through silent years,
Past sorrow’s sigh and fleeting tears.

The City Beneath the Moon

Beneath a sky of argent hue,
A city shines in silver dew,
Where domes like pearls in starlight gleam,
And spires rise from mist and dream.

The streets are paved with whispered song,
Each step a verse, each path prolonged,
A melody of fate untold,
A place where hearts are never old.

But shadows creep where dreams reside,
A silent force that walks beside,
For every joy a sorrow deep,
For every dawn a dusk to keep.

The Forest of Forgotten Names

Beyond the city’s dreaming gate,
A forest waits in patient state,
Where trees bear names upon their bark,
And memories glow in embered dark.

Here whispers drift like autumn leaves,
Of those the world no longer grieves,
Yet still they linger, still they call,
In hopes that someone hears at all.

Each name a tale, each branch a past,
A legacy too vast to last,
Yet in the hush of moonlit air,
Their voices weave a longing prayer.

The Lighthouse at the End of Time

At journey’s end, where dawn breaks wide,
A beacon burns beyond the tide,
A lighthouse stands on fate’s own shore,
Its flame a guide forevermore.

The captain gazes, silent, still,
His vessel bends to ocean’s will,
And as the light consumes the dark,
He steps into the unknown spark.

No fear remains, no chains restrain,
For every loss, a gift remains,
A journey traced in endless spheres,
Across the sea of vanished years.

Epilogue: The Everlasting Wake

The ship is gone, yet still it sails,
Beyond the stars, beyond the veils,
A spectral dream in cosmic flight,
A tale retold in endless night.

For every heart that dares to roam,
Beyond the shores that feel like home,
A voyage waits, a path unknown,
Where every soul may find its own.
